# Program Structures and Algorithms Final Project
Final project of course INFO 6205 Program Structure and Algorithms.
Involves a neural network application built to solve the XOR problem

# Algorithms Used:
- Feed Forward Algorithm

- Back Propagation Algorithm

# Steps :
- Input is given

- Target output is given

- Generates Random output weights and random biases for the layers

- Performs feed forward and back propagation algorithms using matrix arithmatic like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division

- Calculates the sigmoid using the formula 1/(1+e^(-x))

- Calculates the error using cross entropy

- Predicts the output
